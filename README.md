## My portfolio website

⚠️ The website is a Work In Progress.

This is the GitHub repository for [my portfolio website](https://corentin-regent.github.io/). It was
made with the [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) framework, pre-rendered and built as a static
website, and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

The website was designed with speed, accessibility and SEO in mind, therefore it works just fine if
Javascript is disabled. Javascript users will have their experience improved though, thanks to
progressive enhancement.
